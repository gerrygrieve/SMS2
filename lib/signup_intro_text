Welcome to the Student Machine Shop (SMS) Course registration page. 
The department of Physics & Astronomy puts at your disposal a machine 
shop available for students, staff & faculty. Located in Hennings 224, 
the student machine shop (SMS) is equipped with various machines 
(bandsaw, drill press, lathe, milling machine, sheet folding, and shearing machine) 
and hand tools. In order to gain access, you must complete a course where you will 
be taught how to safely use the different tools and machinery. 
Each user MUST comply with the <a href="http://gamma.phas.ubc.ca/sms/sms_handbook_01_v01.pdf">SMS safety regulations</a> [PDF].
 </p><p>
The course consists of 10 separate modules of 4 hours each where you will complete a total of 
4 different projects. Each module will be given at multiple time slots in order to accommodate 
everybody's busy schedule. The first 3 modules cover the safety rules and the basic use of both
the lathe and the milling machine. Therefore, they must be taken first and in order. Once done, 
most of the remaining modules can be taken in any order (see modules prerequisites).
